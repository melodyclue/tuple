## Motivation

There are many link aggregation tools available today, but I wanted to create a super simple profile creation tool that focuses on minimalism.

This project also served as an opportunity to:

- Experiment with modern technologies like Supabase and Next.js 15.
- Implement slightly complex but visually simple features, such as reordering items with drag-and-drop (using `@dnd-kit`) and saving their order.

## Ideas for the future

- Custom domain support for personalized URLs.
- Analytics features to track profile visits.
- Customizable themes to make profiles more visually unique.
