## Built with

- [NextJS 15](https://nextjs.org/)

## How to use

1. Sign in with Google and set your unique username
2. Customize your profile page:
   - Profile Image: Click to upload
   - Name & Bio: Click fields to edit
   - Links:
     - Click "Add Link" and enter title & URL
     - Add up to 10 links
     - Click to edit, trash icon to delete
     - Drag handle on left to reorder

## Motivation

There are many link aggregation tools available today, but I wanted to create a super simple profile creation tool that focuses on minimalism.

This project also served as an opportunity to:

- Experiment with modern technologies like Supabase and Next.js 15.
- Implement slightly complex but visually simple features, such as reordering items with drag-and-drop (using `@dnd-kit`) and saving their order.

## Ideas for the future

- Custom domain support for personalized URLs.
- Analytics features to track profile visits.
- Customizable themes to make profiles more visually unique.
